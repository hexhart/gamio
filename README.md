# Project Summary:
This is based on CP1404 coursework involving reviewing and refactoring an existing Guessing Game written in Python programming.

## Project Details and Involvement:
Some of this is "good" code, but some things are intentionally poor and it is my mission to review the code and refactor it as part of my course work exercise.
